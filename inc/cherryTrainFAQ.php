        <p>No problem. Approach the ferry ticket booth in your car, and ask for a round-trip
          vehicle ticket in addition to the Combination Ferry + Cherry Train Tour ticket.
          Many people bring their car to Washington Island to spend time exploring on their
          own after the narrated tour. Cherry Train Tours do not cover the entire island or
          stop at all points of interest. You will have an opportunity to do so with your
          own transportation on your own schedule, after the introductory tour of Washington
          Island by Cherry Train.</p>

        <p>Our drivers are skilled at making these connections, and receive a high level of
          satisfaction in meeting the return ferries each time! If concerned about a tight
          connection, please ask our driver prior to boarding to reinforce the importance
          of catching the ferry. From the other side of this question, weâ€™d like for your
          tour to be leisurely, not hurried, and you may enjoy a bit of time to shop, buy
          a snack, or just enjoy the scenery and activity prior to boarding for your
          return trip. Your round trip ferry ticket is good for any return ferry, any
          time, any day.</p>
