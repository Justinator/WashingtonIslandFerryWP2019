        <p>Take the <a href="/washington-island-ferry/" class="faqLink">Washington Island Ferry</a>
          (30 min. trip) from Northport Pier—end of State Hwy. 42—to Washington Island. Then, it’s
          approximately 8 miles (20 min.) across Washington Island, from the Washington Island Ferry
          dock to Jackson Harbor, where the Rock Island Ferry is located. Allow time for parking your
          car (free!) and unloading your gear before boarding the Rock Island Ferry. Note: Make sure
          to observe scheduled leaving times for the Rock Island Ferry. </p>

        <p>Park in the State Park lot, adjacent to the State dock in Jackson Harbor. No stickers are required,
          and there is no entry fee to visit Rock Island. But, you’ll need your ticket for the Rock Island
          Ferry. You may purchase combination tickets for the Washington Island Ferry and the Rock Island
          Ferry at the Northport Pier Ticket Booth.</p>

        <p>If you intend to camp on Rock Island, reserve your <a href="dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland" class="faqLink">campsite</a>
          through the state’s website. On busy summer weekends, that is the only way you can be assured of a
          campsite on Rock Island. For day visits, you may park and cross on the Rock Island Ferry, with no
          entry fees required for Rock Island. </p>

        <p>The Rock Island ranger advises packing in only what is necessary for your stay. Be prudent

        <p>Jackson Harbor on Washington Island is an old fishing community. Near the Town Dock
          you will find the Jackson Harbor Maritime Museum, featuring commercial fishing
          history. The “Time Out” concession next to the museum sells soda, hot dogs, ice
          cream, popcorn and other snacks. A conservancy area is adjacent to the beach,
          with interpretive trails. Rock Island State Park offices are at the head of the
          State Dock property in Jackson Harbor. (During the summer season the staff is
          based on Rock Island.) </p>

        <p>Yes, you may beach paddleboats near your campsite. Larger craft may moor near the boathouse,

        <p><strong>Safety Warning!</strong> For your safety, please be aware of impending weather,
          wind and wave conditions. Currents, and even submerged rocks, may also present a hazard.
          Always wear your personal flotation device when boating and let others know where you’re

        <p>You will find Rock Island to be rugged and scenic, yet very friendly for hiking. There
          are well-marked nature trails, and a park naturalist offers his knowledge of plants,
          geology and the history of Rock Island’s early inhabitants. </p>
        <p>
          Two unique structures on Rock Island provide a wonderful historical perspective—the
          Pottawatomie Lighthouse and the C. H. Thordarson Boathouse. The boathouse is at the
          park entrance and is only daily for self-guided visits. In season, docents who live
          in the lighthouse will educate visitors about Rock Island’s light keeping history.
          Excellent books have been published that describe Rock Island’s history. These books
          describe the periods of early native inhabitants, French voyageurs (including LaSalle),
          the fishing village pioneers, and the Rock Island estate of C. H. Thordarson—all of
          which predated the Rock Island State Park.

          Members are from everywhere, not only Wisconsin. They are an abiding passion for nature,
          history and for the lighthouse on Rock Island. </p>
        <p>This is a volunteer organization, but even if you’re not able to volunteer, your financial
          support helps to keep many facets of Rock Island going, and in turn, FORI supports makes
          Rock Island’s camping and visitor experience that much richer for everyone. </p>
