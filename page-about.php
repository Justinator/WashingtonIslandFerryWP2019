						<h2 class="primaryText caps">Ferry History</h2>

						<p>When you reach the end of Highway 42, at the tip of Wisconsin’s Door County
							peninsula, you’ll find Northport Pier and the Washington Island Ferry Line.</p>

						<p>The Washington Island Ferry Line was started in 1940 with two existing wooden
							ferries. Over the years steel ferries were added and today the line boasts
							<a href="/about/fleet/" class="primaryLink">modern,
							Coast Guard-approved vessels</a> that make up to 25 round trips a day during high
							season and two round trips per day in winter.</p>

						<p>After vehicles and passengers are safely on board at the Northport ferry dock,
							the ferry will embark on a 30-minute ride past Plum, Pilot and Detroit Islands.
							This area is filled with history. You will be making the same passage as the
							Native Americans who paddled their canoes from island to island, French explorers
							who came to the area and schooners that traveled this passage a century ago.
							Relax and enjoy the ride!</p>
